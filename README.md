# NYC Citibike Challenge

## Overview of Project

The purpose of our analysis is to analyze the bike-sharing program in NYC to determine if investing in a bike-sharing program in Des Moines is a good idea. This analysis will help stakeholders determine if they would like to invest.

### Summary

There are several insights from the vizualizations. They are as follows:
- The majority of users are male
- The checkout duration of most rides are 20 minute or less
- The most popular times for bike rentals are going to and from work and weekends between 9am and 7pm
- The subscribers make the majority of users
- The starting and ending locations are usually close and the majority are in high population density areas

I would suggest two additional vizualizations for future analysis.
First, the starting and ending locations during weekday rush hour to determine if the flow of bikes evens out or if there is a large migration of bikes to one area causing a shortage in others.
Second, the ending location of the last trip per bike ID per day. This will help determine which areas bikes end up in to help forecast the cost of relocating bikes each night.
